          Where Is Your Personal Data Stored And Data Transfers?
        </h6>
        <p>
          The Al Masaood Website will be, managed and operated from the United Arab Emirates. The data
          collected from you via the Al Masaood Website will be stored on servers in the United Arab Emirates.
          In order to provide you with our services, we may need to transfer your personal information to
          locations outside of the jurisdiction in which you provide it.
        </p>
        <p>
          In accordance with the PDP, Personal data can be transferred outside the UAE where the transfer is
          being made to a jurisdiction that has adopted personal data protection legislation, provided the
          legislation in question reflects the most important provisions, measures, controls, conditions and
          rules for protecting the privacy and confidentiality of personal data, as well as honoring the data
          subject rights afforded by the Laws and provisions relating to the enforcement of the relevant
          requirements by a regulatory or judicial authority. In addition, transfers may occur to countries
          with whom the UAE has signed a multi-lateral or bilateral agreement for the protection of personal
          data. We expect the Data Office to publish a list of countries which will be treated as adequate for
          this purpose. By providing your personal data to the Al Masaood Website, you agree to this transfer,
          storing or processing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Company will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure your data is treated securely, to
          prevent unauthorized access or disclosure and in accordance with this privacy policy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although
          all steps reasonably necessary will be taken to protect your personal data, the security of your
          data transmitted to the Al Masaood Website cannot be guaranteed; any such transmission is at your
          own risk. Information submitted via the Al Masaood Website is normally unprotected until it reaches
          the Company. Users are requested not to send confidential details or credit card numbers, for
          example, by email or the enquiry form. Once your information is received, strict procedures and
          security features will be used to try to prevent unauthorized access.
        </p>

        <h6>
          For How Long Is Your Personal Information Kept?
        </h6>
        <p>
          The time period for which your information is kept varies according to what your information is used
          for. In some cases, there are legal or regulatory requirements to keep data for a minimum period.
          Unless there is a specific legal requirement to keep the information, it will be retained for no
          longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the data was collected or for which it is to be
